  Imagine [**ShaderToy**](https://www.shadertoy.com), on a [**Manim**](https://github.com/3b1b/manim)-like Architecture. That's **ShaderFlow**.

# 🔥 Description

> ShaderFlow is a **Framework** for creating **Real Time** and **Audio Reactive** shaders easily

A complete **Tool** for **Artists**, **Musicians** and **Shader Enthusiasts**:

- Elegant and high quality **Music Visualization** or **Live Performances**
- Render your **Shaders to Videos** with ease

<sub>🚧 This project is under development, not every branded item is available yet 🚧</sub>

### 🔱 Realtime
- **Dynamics**: Bring soul to your shaders with physics-like animations
- **Audio Reactive**: Use music to drive the visuals
- **Live music**: Real time professional video

### ⚙️ Configurable
- **Manim-like**: Make your own complex pipeline and shaders
- **Presets**: Community made awesome shaders
- **Timeline**: Animate your shaders with easy keyframes

### 🎨 Interactive
- **Create and render** shaders easily, explore them with an interactive window
- **Camera 2D and 3D**: Explore your scene in multiple dimensions
- **360° Videos**: Render shaders to 360° videos or Virtual Reality univision

### 🛡️ Trust
- **Quality First**: Any resolution, framerate, bitrate, supersampling
- **No Watermarks**: Non intrusive experience, **user first**
- **Cross Platform**: Windows, Linux and MacOS
- **Open Source**: Trust and transparency

The **possibilities** are **limitless**, create anything with math or use **quality presets**

# 📦 Installation

**ShaderFlow**, similar to [**Manim**](https://github.com/3b1b/manim), is best used directly from a `python` script

## 🪛 Running from the Source Code

> 🔴🟡🟢
>
> **Download** and install our [**Framework**](https://github.com/BrokenSource/BrokenSource) with all the code and projects first
>
> <sub><b>Note:</b> You cannot run this project without the <i>Framework</i></sub>

<br>

**Scene files** are placed under `Scenes/*.py`

- Run `broken shaderflow` to see all available scenes

- Run `broken shaderflow (scene)` to run a specific scene


<br>

## 🔮 Prebuilt Binaries
Whenever stuff gets more stable, we'll likely release pypi packages so you can just `pip install shaderflow` and run it directly from the source code or prebuilt binaries that you can just download and run `./shaderflow scene.py`


<br>
<br>

# 🚧 Hardware Requirements
Highly depends on the shader and number of audio or video inputs
- **CPU:** Any<sup>C1</sup> with a decent single-core performance
- **GPU:** Any<sup>G1,G2</sup> that supports OpenGL 3.3+ and has non zero VRAM (128MB+ free)
- **OS:** Any<sup>O1</sup>, Windows (10+), Linux, macOS
- **RAM:** Depends on the mode:
  - **Realtime**: Minimum 200 MB available, plus 500 MB per 1080p video as texture
  - **Rendering**: Realtime + 650 MB per hour of audio + 2 GB per 1080p video<sup>R1</sup>

<br>

<sub><b>*C1,G1:</b> <i>Affects realtime-able framerates and encoding times, any entry level desktop should be able to do 60 FPS</i></sub>
<br>
<sub><b>*G2:</b> <i>Depends on the shader you want to run, some are intensive. Scales quadratically with resolution</i></sub>
<br>
<sub><b>*O1:</b> <i>Requires supporting to run the current latest Python version</i></sub>
<br>
<sub><b>*R1:</b> <i>A 4k video will take roughly 4x the RAM of a 1080p video on FFmpeg to render</i></sub>

# ❓ Questions, Trivia, FAQ

- **Q:** Why to even Open Source such an ambitious project?

**A:** I'm an autotelic person. This software is a tool I would use myself and prefer it to be _"hackable"_ and Open Source. In plain terms, I want to do something great that lasts, and optimally be the best choice for the job. I am primarily motivated by the possibilities of what the Community members can do with it, I hugely expect the contributions back and am thinking on how we can both grow together.
