Hi, some quick Guidelines (please read, it's not long):

- Consider getting in touch on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/KjqvcYwRHm) or [Telegram](https://t.me/brokensource) first, for faster and real-time responses

- Sometimes, just saying a certain Code or Scene is failing is enough, or saying that "X feature didn't work"

- At least provide the Python Version, Operating System, and if applicable GPU Brand, Video Driver and Server, those can help a lot

- Issues might be file or hardware specific if the project deals with Audio or Video, try testing on a different one also

- You can add Screenshots, Videos or `.log` file on `@Project/Workspace/Logs/*` to help explain the problem (`LOGLEVEL=debug broken (project)`)


Extra:

- Languages we speak, in order of preference: (English 🇺🇸) (Portuguese 🇧🇷)

- Markdown Cheatsheet: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

- Consider using inline code blocks or [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com) for large code snippets

- If you're feeling like it, you can provide a solution, workaround for the issue or the idea of one
