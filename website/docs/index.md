> _Welcome to ShaderFlow's documentation!_

-> Feel free to get in touch for questions and help as things are still a bit rough and technical.

While there is some level of valuable information here, your best chances, otherwise, are on reading the [example](https://github.com/BrokenSource/ShaderFlow/tree/main/examples) scenes and the source code of the package itself.
