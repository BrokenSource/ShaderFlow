You're allowed to freewheel your ideas and formatting here, but here are some suggestions:

- Rejection of ideas on Free and Open Source Software is a common and intimidating problem to newcomers, so we want to reduce the fear and cooperate with you

- Consider getting in touch with us first through [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/KjqvcYwRHm) or [Telegram](https://t.me/brokensource) for discussing the feature and its feasibility, before officializing the request

- Not all suggestions matches the Project's Original Idea. No commentaries are criticizing your person, but your _work_. Stuff needs time and effort to be implemented, consider Donating or Sponsoring us for higher priority.

- **Description**: A description of what the problem is. _"I'm always frustrated when (...)"_

- **Solution**: If you can and applicable, provide mockups or pseudo-codes of the feature you're suggesting

- **Alternatives**: Any alternative solutions or features you've considered
