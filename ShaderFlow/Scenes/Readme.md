  Manim-like scenes for ShaderFlow
</div>


# ðŸ“‚ Examples
This folder contains many proof of concepts and examples on how to use **ShaderFlow**
- Minimal examples showcasing empty scenes, texture mapping, dynamics and more

# ðŸ“‚ User
Place your personal shaders, images, audio files here, use it as a **Workspace**

# ðŸ“‚ Community
Feel free to create a **Folder** or a **Python Script** with your **Username** and **Pull Request** awesome shaders for the **Community**!

- Make sure you own the code rights to the shader you are sharing
- Any legal issues will be your responsibility

Ideally, have the following metadata on your script:

```python
__author__  = ["Your name or username", "Person 2"]
__credits__ = ["Any person", "Or resource that directly helped"]
__license__ = "..."
__email__   = "optional.email@provider.com"
```

This will act as a sort of "legal terms" for your Code, a signature of sorts.
