  Manim-like scenes for ShaderFlow
</div>


# ðŸ“‚ Examples
This folder contains many proof of concepts and examples on how to use **ShaderFlow**
- Minimal examples showcasing empty scenes, texture mapping, dynamics and more
- **Note:** To be considered a Scene file:
  - The substrings `ShaderFlow` and `SombreroScene` must exist on the file contents
  - This is a optimization to avoid scanning non-scene files, potentially dangerous ones

<sub>We can't guarantee stuff won't be broken in the future ðŸ˜…</sub>

# ðŸ“‚ User
Place your personal shaders, images, audio files here, use it as a **Workspace**

# ðŸ“‚ Community
Feel free to create a **Folder** or a **Python Script** with your **Username** and **Pull Request** awesome shaders for the **Community**!

- Make sure you own the code rights to the shader you are sharing
- Any legal issues will be your responsibility

See [SombreroScene](../ShaderFlow/Sombrero/SombreroScene.py) for an example of a **Scene** with **Metadata**.

This will act as a sort of "legal terms" for your Code, a signature of sorts.
