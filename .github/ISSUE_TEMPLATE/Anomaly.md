## Description
{A description of what the bug is. What happened and what is the expected behavior? What caused it and/or steps to reproduce?}

- {For installation issues, please use the [Monorepo](https://github.com/BrokenSource/BrokenSource) Issues}

- {Consider getting in touch with us first through [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/KjqvcYwRHm) or [Telegram](https://t.me/brokensource) if you think the issue is too simple or complex. If you're not sure, don't worry continuing with the issue}

- {Please, show some effort of understanding or solving the problem. We know the code is deep and advanced, but often the simple things are the cause of the problem}

- {No need to explain explicitly or in-depth the expected behavior, sometimes saying a certain code is failing and providing the traceback is enough, or saying that "X feature didn't work"}

- {You can get a clean `.log` file on the path `@Project/Workspace/Logs/*.log` folder for attaching the file to the issue. Preferably execute the project with `LOGLEVEL=debug broken (project)`. **‚ö†Ô∏è Check or clear for any private information before uploading it**}

- {You can add Screenshots or Videos to help explain your problem}

- {If the issue happens on some script of yours, consider providing the script or a minimal example that reproduces the issue. Consider using [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com) or inline code blocks}
