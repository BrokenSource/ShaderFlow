Running from source couldn't be easier:

- Have [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed in your system
- Clone the repository and chdir into it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/BrokenSource/ShaderFlow && cd ShaderFlow
```

- Run the project - uv manages everything for you:

```sh
uv run shaderflow (...)
```
